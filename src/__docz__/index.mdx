üëÅÔ∏è **[Live Demo](https://devboldly.github.io/react-bootswatch-select-demo/)**

## Overview

Drop a [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme selector onto your React site with just one line!

This package includes three components:

- [BootswatchSelect](/BootswatchSelect) - A Bootswatch theme selector that supports three modes: visible, hidden, and display-only.
- [Bootstrap](/Bootstrap) - A component for easily adding Bootstrap to your site, for convenience.
- [FontAwesome](/FontAwesome) - A component for easily adding Font Awesome to your site, for convenience.

By default, all CSS is loaded from [bootstrapcdn.com](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/).

### Features include:

- **üé® Easily try Bootswatch themes**
  - Want to quickly skin your Bootstrap site? Drop this component in and try out Bootswatch with one line!
- **üå† Build beautiful prototypes quickly**
  - Quickly swatch out your next big project so you can focus on the stuff that matters.
- **üéõÔ∏è Visible, hidden, and display-only modes**
  - Several modes for the level of integration that suits you.
- **üéÅ Quickly drop in [Bootstrap](/Bootstrap) and [Font Awesome](/FontAwesome)**
  - For convenience, Bootstrap and Font Awesome CDN components are included to get you up and running fast.

## Installation

```
npm i react-bootswatch-select
```

## Quick Start

If Bootstrap is loaded already:

#### Selector Visible

```jsx
import { BootswatchSelect } from 'react-bootswatch-select';
...
<BootswatchSelect version={'4.4.1'} className="form-control" />
```

This `select` will dynamically add the theme CSS link in the `head` when a Bootswatch style is selected.

#### Selector Hidden

```jsx
import { BootswatchSelect } from 'react-bootswatch-select';
...
<BootswatchSelect version={'4.4.1'} selectedThemeName="cerulean" selectorHidden />
```

This will add the Bootswatch CSS theme selected in the `head` and not render the `select` on the page.

#### Display-Only (No Head Link)

```jsx
import { BootswatchSelect } from 'react-bootswatch-select';
...
<BootswatchSelect className="form-control" disableHeadLink />
```

This will render the `select` only and will not dynamically add the selected theme CSS link in the `head`. It just becomes a plain old `select`. Use `onChange` to listen for selection changes.

### Bootstrap + Bootswatch

If you'd like to load Bootstrap (or Font Awesome) from the CDN before the [BootswatchSelect](/BootswatchSelect) is used:

```jsx
import { Bootstrap, FontAwesome, BootswatchSelect } from 'react-bootswatch-select';
...
<Bootstrap version={'4.4.1'} />
<FontAwesome version={'4.7.0'} />
<BootswatchSelect version={'4.4.1'} className="form-control" />
```

All CSS is loaded from [bootstrapcdn.com](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) by default. Check there for the latest version.

Font Awesome is not required for [BootswatchSelect](/BootswatchSelect), but is included here in case you want it.

## TypeScript

Type definitions have been included for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support.
